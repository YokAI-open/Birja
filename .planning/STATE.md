## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions. Recent, already settled:

- Holdings valued at mid price
- Single scheduler-loop container for prices; OTP email via FastAPI BackgroundTasks (no Celery/arq)
- Kraken public Ticker as price source
- "$ amount" on buys = total cash spent including fee

### Pending Todos

- Buy a domain and start Resend DNS verification now (Phase 1, wall-clock latency)
- Upgrade Node 18 to 24 and set up shadcn in Phase 1

### Blockers/Concerns

- Phase 3: confirm Kraken pair/response-key map and rate limit live when freezing the coin list
- Phase 6: certbot, nginx and Resend DNS details unverified; use Let's Encrypt staging first
